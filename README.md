### Link to Deployed Website
https://anxiouscat333.github.io/knittygritty/

### Goal and Value of the Application
The application is an e-commerce website that allows users to shop high quality knit products for keeping warm and stylish!

### Usability Principles Considered

### Organization of Components
My external component is shopdata.js from where I store all the merchandise data. I call onto it when populating the 
site using props and update the state of the data using filtration and sorting using states. I also use states when 
populating or updating the cart and total price of ites in the cart


### How Data is Passed Down Through Components
Data is passed through components by axporting and importing data and manipulating it
### How the User Triggers State Changes
State changes are trigerred when: 1. Applying filters 2. Applying sort 3. The cart is updated 4. Cart price is updated
